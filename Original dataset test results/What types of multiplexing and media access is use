1.What types of multiplexing and media access is used in GSM and DECT systems ?

GSM SDMA is used to assign MS to BS
FDD to seperate uplink and downlink
FDMA 124 channels, 200khz and TDMA 8, 577us time slots are used for media access. 

DECT use TDD to separate upload and download, 24 slots, 12 uplink and 12 downlink
10 carrier frequencies, 120 full duplex channels

2.  Compared to the TCHs offered, standard GSM could provide a much higher data rate (33.8 kbit/s) when looking at the air interface. What lowers the data rates available to a user?

Foward error correction is required to minimize the transmission error.
Bandwith is also required for signalling and garding space.

3.Why is a new infrastructure needed for GPRS, but not for HSCSD? Which components are new and what is their purpose?
